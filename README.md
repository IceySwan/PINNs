# PINNs
This repository is used to store the PINN code reproduction of the papers I have read, and record my inspirations and ideas.

If it’s useful for you, give me a star, please!

## Workflow

My workflow is based on PyCharm 2024.3 and MATLAB R2024a. All code is run on an ASUS TUF Gaming A14 (华硕天选 Air 2024). 
with the following device configuration: 

```
CPU AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX
GPU NVIDA 4060 Laptop
RAM 32.0 GB
```

And the Python requirements are as follows:

```
Python 3.11.10
torch 2.5.1 
CUDA 12.4 
scipy 1.14.1
```

For more details, please refer to `requirements.txt` or `environment.yml` in the `environment` folder.
